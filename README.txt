The file "basefunctions.ml" contains several functions to:
- work with list
- calculate power (x^y)
- calculate Fibonacci (basic function)
- factorial
- etc...

all this functions are Non-tail recursive and only to show how they works

The file "tail-recursive-version" contains all previous functions developed in a tail recursive version.
